 # Wallet Manager: Streamlined Digital Fund Transfers  
 
## Description
Wallet Manager is a robust and efficient application designed to simplify and secure digital fund transfers between user wallets. With an intuitive interface and powerful backend, Wallet Manager ensures seamless transactions and comprehensive management of user wallets.
 
## Prerequisites      
- Docker  
- Docker Compose 
- PostgreSQL client 

## Getting Started
 
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/saadozone/Secure-Go-Wallet.git
``` 
Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the following environment variables:
```
POSTGRES_USER=saadbinnoman
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
POSTGRES_DB=yourdatabase
```
Step 3: Docker Compose Up
Navigate to the project directory and run Docker Compose to set up the PostgreSQL database container:
``` docker-compose up```
Step 4: Create a New User:

Exec into the PostgreSQL container and create a new user:
```docker exec -it your-project-db-container psql -U saadbinnoman -d postgres```
Once inside the PostgreSQL shell, run:
```
CREATE USER newusername WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE postgres TO newusername;
```
Step 5: Perform SQL Data Dump
To load your initial data and create the necessary tables and foreign keys, you need to perform an SQL data dump. Assuming your SQL dump file is named database_dump.sql and located in the root of your project directory, run:
```
docker cp database_dump.sql your-project-db-container:/database_dump.sql
docker exec -it your-project-db-container psql -U saadbinnoman -d postgres -f /database_dump.sql
```
Usage
Checking the Source of Funds Table
To check if the source_of_funds table exists and view its contents:
```
docker exec -it your-project-db-container psql -U saadbinnoman -d postgres

# Inside the PostgreSQL shell
\dt public.source_of_funds
SELECT * FROM public.source_of_funds;

```
